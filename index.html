                    Keisha Diane Shepherd is an Electrical/Systems Engineer with an
                    abiding commitment to community service and the economic
                    empowerment of family, friends, and members of the Millennial
                    Generation. Upon graduating from Oakland Mills High School (Howard
                    County, MD), she obtained a full academic scholarship and pursued a
                    degree in Electrical Engineering at Morgan State University. Upon
                    graduating from Morgan State University, she began her working career
                    with Lockheed Martin, and while there, pursued and obtained a
                    Master’s Degree in Systems Engineering at George Washington
                    University.
                    <br><br>
                    After performing at exceptionally high levels at corporations such as
                    Lockheed Martin, Sotera Defense, Northrup
                    Grumman, and Interconnect Defense LLC.
                    In addition to Keisha’s vast accomplishments in corporate America,
                    under the mentorship of her mother, Betty Shepherd, she has gained
                    the knowledge necessary to successfully navigate the intricacies of the
                    financial world as well. At the age of 16, local publications sought her
                    out to discuss financial strategies on wealth accumulation, managing
                    credit card debt, and understanding the negative implication of interest
                    rates, etc. She was able to purchase her first vehicle at the age of 16,
                    purchase her first home at the age of 24, and most importantly,
                    without any assistance from anyone (parents included). Recently, she
                    established the Keisha Shepherd Scholarship Endowment Fund at
                    Morgan State University to support female students in pursuit of an
                    Engineering Degree.
                    <br><br>
                    Keisha also loves travel and has been to many places. She shares her knowledge on how to save money
                    when
                    traveling, how best to book hotels and airfare, and details on things to do while traveling.
